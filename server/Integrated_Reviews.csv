5,cute place on a side street - really only serving the locals around the woodbinedanforth area. bf ordered a coffee here that he thought was pretty goodthey seem to have smoothies and fresh juices as welland nifty rice bowls will be back to try out the juices and food. seems to be a quiet place to chill for a couple of hours.,0
6,atmosphere for this restaurant is nice but service not so much came here for a friend's birthdayalthough we made reservations and checked in a few minutes early we still had to wait a good 45 minutes before sitting down at our tablewhen we made the reservations we were informed we would have to leave a certain time - which we didn't think they would enforce considering we did not get our table in timehowever they did and we were not impressed. the space in the restaurant is also very tight my boyfriend got hit in the head a few times while sitting at the table. i had ordered a seafood pasta dish which was kind of bland (not much flavour)my boyfriend had ordered one of the specials of the night - filet mignon which also was not up to par. overall i've had better pastai'm not sure if it was just the two dishes i had that wasn't up to par as my other friends did enjoy theirs.,0
7,the loud banging always draws crowds as you walk by and see that the chef is making fresh noodlesnoodles are delicious and you definitely need to make sure you save room in your stomach for this when you come to pacific mall! after trying a few things on the menu - the true favourite is still the dan dan noodlesthere is something about the spicy peanut sauce soup base that makes it so flavourfulplus when you add their homemade chili oil - it makes it so good. because of sun's dan dan noodles - my bf and i will always order the dan fan noodle whenever we see it on the menu but so far no one has the same flavour as sun'ssun's is the best we have had!!!,0
8,found this bakery while wandering on queen street - it was hidden on a side street. walked inside to check it out and it was very quaint insidelots of varietywe had gotten a loaf of brioche bread - it was so goodsoft and sweet - just the way it should be. they have lots of other bread that i can't wait to go back and try!,0
9,terrible service and not so great drinks. we happen to be in the plaza and saw this place for bubble tea so we decided to grab a few to go. first of all the two menus is located in a very awkward place (one very high up on the wall and one in the corner also by the wall) set up is not really friendly neither can it accommodate a large group of people to look at the menu at the same time. the menu items itself had different options than your typically bubble tea placetheir specialty are mousse drinks - which we had no idea what exactly it wasso when we asked the staff they said it was some sort of cheese for a sunday afternoon they were also out of grass jelly and pudding which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks (so not sure how that works). the service is really bad they don't understand english so when you asked them about the menu items they can't really explain what they are. we had ordered the following- slush mango (came with tapioca and mousse)- peach ice tea- roasted oolong milk tea- supernova kumquat lemonade and when we asked what the difference between a supernova kumquat lemonade under the galaxy drinks section (which are supposed to be layered drinks) and the kumquat lemonade they said it had a layer of blue mousse - so we were like ok we will try it thenbut what came was just a bigger cup size of the kumquat lemonadewhen we asked them again they said it was just a size difference that's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large the mango slush and the roasted oolong milk tea wasn't badbut the other two was not that greatthe tea had a big floral taste that overpowered everythingthere was no peach taste in the peach ice teathe kumquat one had no kumquat taste and was just bitter from the lime and it tasted like it had no sugar in it at all. i guess if you need a non-busy place to use wifi and work then this is the place no one wants to come here. also - their gimmick also seems to be the lightbulb drinks which were intriguing to us but you are not allowed to take the lightbulb home we will definitely not be returning,1
10,worse customer service evermanager on duty was rudeshe didn't care that i had negative feelings about this place when i said that i would never come back again!restaurant has gone downhill since they renovated!!,0
11,my boyfriend took me here for my birthdayat first i wasn't impress that it was a 45 mins wait however my bf really wanted to try this piece so we decided to wait. it was definitely different and worth the wait we started off with the house cured meat - it was good - but definitely too much for just 2 people to share (and no need to order the extra bread if it's only two people). next came the roasted bone marrow - which is amazing and definitely worth orderinghad we not ordered so many other dishes we would have ordered a second round of thiswho knew bone marrow could be this tasty!! then came the spicy horse tartare which we thought was intriguing as we have never heard so we had ordered itwhen it showed up it was like a saladwasn't bad worth trying but probably only a one-time thing for us. tongue on brioche is definitely another worth orderingit is a sandwich that tasted like a montreal smoked meat sandwichso good that it melts in your mouth - so soft and tenderif it wasn't because we had ordered so much food and this was the last main course that showed up we would have devoured it. for dessert we had ordered the foie and nutella as we thought this was very interestingit was good but after 4 dishes already this was just a little too richit came with banana bread that was really good. overall definitely worth the try! just make sure you bring cash =),0
12,omg - came here with some friends for brunch and wow! we did have to wait for about 30 mins for a table for 4 (but it was later in the day) looking at their menu we wanted to try everything! the french toast the strawberry shortcakes..donuts (they were sold out by the time we got there). but we wind up only ordering two things  the classic - 2 eggs any style house cured bacon or sage and onion sausage crispy griddled red skin potatoes with sea salt and thymeserved with toast of your choiceupgrade your toast to a buttermilk biscuit  emma's benny - warm and fluffy buttermilk biscuit topped with house cured peameal bacon poached eggs and smothered in mousselline sauceserved with a side of griddled red skin potatoes. big portions - really good! if you want the benny make sure you asked them if they still have it as they tend to sell out quick - i had ordered the last one of the day!!!,0
13,this place is always so dirty and grimy been there twice and will not be backcustomer service is horrible!!!,0
14,i bought a groupon voucher for double wings artwhen i tried to use it they did not recognize it and told me to go back to grouponthis is not a customer friendly place and as of now i think i may have been scammed.,0
15,a couple of weeks ago i was watching diner's drive-ins and divesbig mistake! this show is a heart attack in the making. it also gives you cravingsoften for food you can't possibly get because they're making some crazy thing across the country that you cannot possibly find a duplicate for naturally i got a crazy craving for fish and chipsmy mistake being that this was a sunday and for whatever reason no fish and chip places are open on sunday i did a lot of looking around before i found this place which wasn't too far away and was most importantly open!  this is a quirky place with wood panelling on the walls and some random fish hung around the place. fry's boasts full day breakfasts and the fish and chipsi saw plenty of people coming for the full day breakfasts which are decently priced and looked pretty good if nothing special. we came for the f&cs though!  we ordered the single piece which was more than enough foodquite expensive thoughyou're looking at around $15meal of one large piece of fish and some fries. it was good but it wasn't greatworst of all the tartar sauce came in sealed packages.ugh. i'm sorry but when i'm paying a premium for my fish and chips at a place named after it's fish and chipsi want some damn proper tartar sauce! it's only like the easiest thing in the world to make. service was fineno complaintsthe waitress did her jobtook our order gave us our food and gave us the bill.that was her job and she did no more and no less. the restaurant ambiance wasn't there the food wasn't special and the prices weren't good. next time i get a fish and chips craving i'm going to try elsewhere.,0
16,i went here with my husband and another couple as the start to our double date nighti reserved a table on the wednesday before and i'm glad i did but even still we were originally seats in a less than ideal tablei spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us which was very nice of them because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats!  i have walked by this restaurant a million times and never known it was thereit is directly on bloor but in a small mall which houses the japanese foundation and some other businessesthe restaurant is on the second floor and there are no readily visible signs on the street so you would never think to just walk into this placemaybe that's the point!  the decor of the restaurant is really lovelythey have a huge stain glass ceiling and dark wooden furniture and art nouveau decorthe bathrooms are large individually sectioned off stall with white and black tiles everywhere and large vintage french ads on the walls two of our party ordered from the winterlicious menu one ordered from the regular menu and i ordered from their regular prix fixe menu which they have available all the time and is $7 more than the winterlicious they were also offering some winterlicious cocktailsi had three (the same one) and they were excellent our appetizers included two salads which looked great and (according to the orderes) weremy husband ordered the onion soup from the winterlicious menu and it was great and i ordered the mushroom soup from the prix fixe and it was excellent! the main courses included steak from the regular menu which were ordered with steak fritesthe steak was a nice cut of meat prepared exactly as asked and the steak frites were served with a garlic aioli (which we all tried) and was really good! the lasagna and pork belly were ordered from the winterlicious menulasagna came in a rounded dish where it had been baked and was on the smaller side but satisfying within a three course mealmy husband had the pork belly from the winterlicious menu and i tried thatthe sauce on it and the tenderness of the pork were really nice i had the pistachio chicken which was a huge dish! the chicken breast was served on top of another cut of chicken but in dark meatboth had pistachios on top and delicious sauces drizzled along the bottom of the plate and a few apple slices as garnishi couldn't finish two pieces of chicken and i stuck mostly with the white meat but it was a nice option to have to two and i tried the dark and it was really excellent as well!  the reason i chose the prix fixe menu over the winterlicious was because of the dessertthe winterlicious had the pistachio chicken as a main and the onion soup was an option for the appetizer but the desserts set the prix fixe aparton the winterlicious menu the option was a rhubarb crumble or chocolate mousseneither of which i really cared for although i tried it from my husband and it was goodon the prix fixe menu you have a choice of creme brule (which i have heard good things about) and a sticky toffee cakei asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the sticky toffee because it was such a lovely winter desserti had been set on the creme brule but you know what.brules are a dime a dozenhow many places have sticky toffee cake?  i was not disappointedthe cake was amazing! it was a small singular bundt cake topped with a toffee crisp and a small scoop of caramel ice cream and surrounded on the plate with warm caramelit was decadent and delicious finally i'll mention that our server was lovely and attentive and not a single person in our party were disappointed in any waywe all left very happy and satisfied this place is a little on the pricier end (would have been less so except for the three drinks myself and my friend had and the beers that the guys had) but it's great for a nice night out or a romantic date i will definitely come back some time in the future.,0
17,listen these bagels are goodvery good but they didn't blow me awayin fact i thought the everything bagel and the garlic bagels were downright disgustingno like inedible disgustingthe best ones were the basic plain ones (for me) anyway it was a fun place to go to and pick up a snacknot a great place to get drinks to go with the snack since they only seem to sell whole cartons of juice glad i tried it would try it again but probably wouldn't go out of my way to do so but that's mepeople seem to be die hard montreal bagel fans and if that's you i think you hold this place in much higher esteem! all the power to ya!,0
18,i was in a big rush trying to get ready for a night out and needed my nails done so i popped into here basically because it was close and they said they could take me right away i had never been in before because the price list was pricey but decided that given my rush i would bite the bullet and suck it up. the people were all very pleasanti said i was wearing a purple dress and asked for feedback on colours and they gave good opinions and were very nicethen i was led into a back rooms where i was instructed to sit on a padded bench and put my feet in a large metal bowl of waterthis was a new onei have never had to put my feet in a mixing bowl while getting nails done. the seat while padded was not particularly comfortable and it was awkward getting up on it and off it againthe pedicure was standard with most places i have been. the nails were more in keeping with what i was used to sitting at a nail tablei said i was in a bit of a rush but she still seemed to really take her timei didn't push it because i didn't want to be rudethe nails were fine but not perfectsome have some bubbling in the polish and others are a bit crooked. here's the kicker thoughthe bill came to $60!! that's almost twice as much as other nail places and it's certainly not a better place in terms of the facilities and job they do! that doesn't even include tip. the people in there were all older and seemed to be regulars so i guess they have a customer base but i certainly won't be part of that! even in a rush this place was just not worth itthere are a number of nail salons popping up in the area as it continues to get built upthey better watch themselves because with so many other options there is no reason to go here.,0
19,we were in the area and absolutely starving and i had a craving for pub fare so this seemed to fit the bill especially because it's had a few good reviews but i found it only so-so decor another reviewer mentions that the decor seems to be missing something and i agreeit's boringthe booths had gaps where the seat meets with the wooden bench part that holds the seat part uphard to describe but looks cheap and crappy like they're brokenour table was very unbalanced and the waitress came and stuck a coaster under it so it would stop rockingit's small and very cramped food selection was pretty standard pub fare but a bit on the expensive sidei ordered a chicken curry dish and when they asked if i wanted it to be spicy or mild i asked for it to be mildeither their mild is just very spicy and i would hate to try their actual spicy or they made a mistakethe curry comes with the chicken in sauce rice and a sort of fried crisp which was nicethe rice was bland howeveror the spice from the curry killed my tastebudsmy husband chose a burger which was overall very good although they charged him two dollars each for bacon and cheese on the burger which is expensive when your burger is already $15not sure the bacon added anything but the cheese i'll admit was really good on this burger atmosphere and service service was finebut since this seems to be a trendor the gods are intent on making me detest children while eating out we had another loud rude childnegligent parent situation (see post on malaysian place)another situation where children were screaming and running around and parents were sitting off by themselves ignoring them while the rest of the people in the restaurant had to sufferthe group of older individuals across from us kept leaning over to make comments to us and the two ladies nearby grumbled under their breath once again this was a problem that could easily have been solved by the restaurantthe kids were part of a party and were in a party room which is adjacent but separate from the rest of the dining roomthis room had doors on itwhich close but were propped wide openall the waitress had to do was go and quietly shut the doorsthat's it! problem solved we were getting annoyed and so we didn't bother ordering desserttoo bad because they actually looked greatthe group across from us ordered a few and were commenting on how good they were. so yeahi actually would have given this pub 2 stars even without the screaming kid but if the screaming kid had not been a problem we probably would have stayed for dessert and who knows maybe these guys would be getting 3+ starsthat said it just didn't do it for meoverpriced for only okay food and poor atmosphere.,1
20,typical mcdonaldsfood was typicalemployees were typicalwait time was typicalclientele was typicaltypical.,0
21,stopped in here this evening for a drinkbar was packedwe managed to squeeze up to the bar and order a drinkwe had to take our drinks to a table as there was nowhere at the bar to sit. the bartender noticed us as soon as we came inshe got us each a drink although she didn't seem none to friendly about itshe had that i hate my job personality. definitely not a friendly vibe in herehad the feeling if you're not gambling you're not welcome.,0
22,i thought tidy's flowers had a great reputation as a florist but i guess i was wrong! for valentine's day my boyfriend had ordered roses with tidy'showever the flowers that were delivered was not what he had orderedhe had placed in an order for long stem roses mixed with orchids and was charged for thatwhat had showed up was a small vase with 4 short cut roses and some greens - table ornament not really valentine's day flowers in speaking with another friend something similar happened to her - her fiancee had ordered a dozen of roses for her for valentine's day while he was in germany as a surprise and they never showed upso when he called them to complaint they actually then called up my friend to confirm whether or not she had received the flowerswhich she didn't so they said they would resend - only to have them deliver it to the wrong place. understanding that valentine's day is the most busiest day for florists and mistakes do happen the way they had handled it was not what would have been expected from a florist of that nature.,1
23,this place reminds of st lawrence market in toronto but more veggies and fruits then seafood. fruits and veggies look so good! too bad we didn't have a kitchen at our hotel room cause we would have bought and cooked up a storm!! lots of varieties of apples!,0

25,worse customer service evermanager on duty was rudeshe didn't care that i had negative feelings about this place when i said that i would never come back again!restaurant has gone downhill since they renovated!!,0
26,my sister is a big fan of the noodles here as they do have some soup options with no msg the way the system works is that it is a combo - soup base option (no msg fish soup or chicken soup base)- two toppings are included with additional toppings at $1.75 each- types of noodles- 1 hot drink is included but other options have an additional charge then you also have an option of adding side items. i had ordered the parsley and century egg fish soup with fish filet fish tofu cabbage and flat rice noodlesnot sure if it is due to the type of noodles i had picked but i found it a little lacky in flavour. otherwise it wasn't bad pretty big portionsi would also upgrade to a cold drink next time since the hot lemon tea that i had gotten wasn't really that great.,0
27,tried to book an appointment to use the voucher my friend had given meit was for a manipedifoot massageleft a message but never heard back. finally decided to email them requesting for an appointmentthe response i got back was they are under new ownership and is no longer accepting the vouchers. such a disappointment!,1
28,they sell wrecked vehicles! i purchased a 2010 nissan altima with 41 000 miles on it in 2013 from planet nissanthey charged me $18 000 and provided me with no warranty except for manufacturer powertrainimmediately after purchasing the vehicle i began having to make out of pocket repairs to the suspension brakes and exhaust system every 6 to 9 months with absolutely no clue as to why after all the repairs the car still drove somewhat unsteady at high speedstwo years after i bought the car i was finally sick of the constant problems and decided to trade it in with another dealership during the trade in process i found out that planet nissan had sold the vehicle to me knowing that it was involved in a major car accident which caused frame damage six months prior to them selling it to me.unfortunately there's not much i can do now but i would advise any savvy consumer to avoid this dealership by all means possible and go someplace that is a bit more reputable!,1
29,we got a permit to have wedding photos taken herethe garden itself was great 5 stars all around. the staff was horriblethe person manning the place claimed there were no bathrooms complained about where our group was standing (twice!) and then warned us that 'if you aren't out on time i will come in and find you and i really don't want to do that.' its been a long time since i was treated so rudely go to the garden avoid the staff.,1
30,this place is always so dirty and grimy been there twice and will not be backcustomer service is horrible!!!,0

33,noi've had it with this placei refuse to go backmanagement changed sometime last year and this place took a huge diveworse than before.there is one waitress who works the entire restaurantthe service is hugely lacking as a result. last time i went they had half price appetizerswe were told that they couldn't separate the bill and she brought us one large bill.oh but she couldn't subtract the half price from our apps because she needed the manager who wasn't there to do itso she found different items that were the same cost as the half price items we got and made the bill with them.well how in hell are we supposed to divide up our bill based on items we didn't order????!? it was actually shockingly stupid we all guessed as best we could and threw in cashi for one threw in the towel toothe food continues to be subpar at best the prices are not great even with half price and the service is horrendously terriblethis place is a waste of time and money.,1
34,i can't figure out why this place has so many good reviewsthat was why we chose to order from this place and it was a big mistakemy husband called and placed the order and we got a call back saying they had taken down his credit card number incorrectlythen they called back a few minutes later because they needed directions to our placewe proceeded to get three more calls from a driver asking us where to gothe confusing thing was that he would ask but then either carry on a conversation on another phone or with someone who was with him instead of listeningthen he would ask for my husband to repeat himselfthis happened at least twice every call for three calls turns out they took the address down completely wrongbig surprise considering their listening skills we finally got our food and they had screwed up the order and given us a wrong sushi rolleither way the sushi was among the worst we have tastedit was a mixture of bland and salty! basically it was terrible on a side note their dragon rolls are actually unagi rollsdragon rolls are called dragon rolls (at every other sushi place) because they have avocado on top making them greenit is very strange that these guys have decided that that's not the way they want to go so yeah terrible service and bad foodyou can bet we won't be bothering with this place again ever!,1
35,small location with some seating out fronthard to get into and place order and wait to receive iteveryone ends up smooshed together and waiting and they certainly take their timei asked if they did flavoured lattes (excaramel latte)nope they do what they list on their menuno morei ordered a regular lattenothing speciali have tried a few food items here and nothing was particularly goodi'd take a passthere are way better coffee shops in the mall.,0
36,we got a coupon to eat here when we checked in $6.99 for breakfast and a second one for half or free or something to that effectwe went and had our breakfasts which was served by a rather surely waitress and was averageif this had been our only experience i would have given three stars but another night we got in very late and were just looking for a late dinner and found ourselves at this place.it was not very crowded but was as loud as if three times as many people were therethere was a small group of trashy (very obese people) screamsinging karaoke on a stage in the front of the restaurantone of them was singing eminem and the others were screaming and cheeringwe sat down in the back to try and avoid the chaos but it was way too disruptiveother people sitting there who were in the middle of their dinners and therefore stuck there were looking painedwe didn't bother putting ourselves through this and leftit's a crappy menu that's overpriced anyway.i guess rock and rita's name really says it all but basically if you're not a fall-down cheap drunk i don't think you'll have much to say about this place.,0
37,food is very bland - not authentic at all. meant to cater to the customers who have never eaten vietnamese food before. definitely will not be returning!,0
38,while looking at different restaurants in the area came upon this restaurant posting and decided to try it as it is down the street from work. not bad when you want something slightly cheaper than congee starit is a mix of chinese and choy suey menu.,0
39,service is really slow herei waited for over 25 mins just for takeoutdefinitely not worth the waithowever they seem to have live music friday nites so if you are looking for entertainment and food sit-in is probably a lot faster,0
40,a few years ago this used to be the place to be for bunchi was really excited to take my boyfriend here to experience one of the must visit places in mtlboy were we disappointed! we had ordered the eggspectation omelette and eggs benedictthe omelette was bland overcookedthe eggs benedict were ok but i've had betterthe portion size has come down. overall food and service has gone downhill and not worth my time anymore.,0
41,omg - definitely worth going if you are in montreal!! and remember to eat it fresh - it is amazing paired with an organic cream cheesemmmm.,0
42,not sure what the hype is but decided to give this a try based on all the reviews. maybe it was too hyped up but it wasn't as amazing as i thought it would bemaybe it was what we had ordered but it was just okwe had ordered the kimchi fries which was kind of like a ny fries the worksthe grilled pork banh mi was ok will be back to try other stuff like the bao version and the pork belly.,0
43,love the selection of winter gear here for my little one! we are a big fan of the canadan pooch line and they carry a variety of jackets and sweaters hereand it's not just for big dogs - they have different sizes to fit all different size dogs. good selection of treats and food as well!,0
44,hidden on the east end of the danforth is a lovely thai restaurantfound this restaurant while surfing on yelp. surprisingly this place is pretty big to seat a big group of 12 and still have a few more small tables availablethey are mainly a take-out restaurant as many of the customers came in for take-out and the service was a little bit slowhowever the food was great and it accommodating for many different people - seafood lovers vegans etc. definitely recommend the basil fried rice and the fried sole fish with eggplant but for those curry lovers out there stay away from the roti curry chicken - no curry taste just coconut favourbut the roti itself was really good. most of the dishes were under $10 - definitely a good deal! will be back to try the noodle dishes!,0
45,if you have not yet tried wasabi - don't bother. it's expensive and the food is disgustingyou have to order the sushi at the table but everything else (i.esalads soups cooked food) you can get up and go get it yourself. the food is very bland the sushi does not taste like anything - not even sure if the fish is fresh. on the weekends everyone seems to be there for the snow crab legs - if that's what you are coming for forget it! you have to fightwait in-line to get itit's probably easier to eat it at mandarin. if anyone suggests to go there i highly recommend you go somewhere else!,0
46,decided to try this place after reading the reviewswas not disappointedhuge portions and a bit of a long waitthey will take phone orders over the walk insso call ahead to order! tried the burrito with rice but will be back to try the noodle version!!,0
47,great place to bring dogs! it's really a dog place that you bring your humans p as soon as we walked in my dog was greeted with treats! he was so excited to explore the store there are 4 seats that you can sit and have your coffee while your dog lounges in the dog bed in front of you truth - this really a store for dogs not so much for humans even though they offer coffee and tea - but just a handful of choices nothing crazy )  the great part is my dog is very picky when it comes to his treats and he really likes the one we had purchased hereguess we will be back for more,0
